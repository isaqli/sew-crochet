# Stich and Thread

This website has a small collection of my favorite resources that helped me get better at sewing and crocheting. I made it to be a helpful guide for anyone else who's looking to improve too. I built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can switch between beginner and intermediate project videos, techniques, and tools using the tab above. I had a difficult time coding with JavaScript since Iâ€™m still learning, but I eventually got it to work. Now when you click a tab, it shows the right content and makes the site feel more interactive.
